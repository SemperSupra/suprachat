# SupraChat prototype

Windows-first, cross-platform ChatGPT parity client and actor-interview surface.

Architecture:

1. ChatGPT parity surface: an Avalonia NativeWebView pointed at the official https://chatgpt.com/ top-level experience. This inherits the user's normal ChatGPT product/session instead of cloning undocumented backend APIs.
2. Agent Lab: OpenAI's documented Sign in with ChatGPT / ChatGPT-plan usage flow, direct streamed Responses API calls, and an optional Codex app-server binding.

The separation is intentional: the SIWC preview route does not expose every ChatGPT product capability. The official ChatGPT surface remains the parity path; Agent Lab is the empirical actor qualification path.

Security boundaries:

- no browser-cookie scraping;
- no undocumented ChatGPT backend endpoints;
- OAuth uses the system browser, PKCE S256, state, nonce, dynamic client registration, and OIDC ID-token validation;
- the required chatgpt.tokens.use.direct grant is checked before inference;
- Responses calls force store=false and stream=true;
- tokens are never passed on a command line or logged;
- Codex app-server receives the token only through ACCESS_TOKEN;
- local credential state remains outside Git.

Current parity posture:

The embedded official ChatGPT surface is intended to carry normal chat/history/model selection, files/images, memory/projects/search/images and web voice according to the user's account and the official web product. Mobile-only Advanced Voice video/screen-share behavior remains a tracked parity gap until an official desktop/web surface or a native adapter is qualified.

Build:

dotnet build SupraChat/SupraChat.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project SupraChat.ContractTests/SupraChat.ContractTests.csproj -c Release

Windows 11 includes the Edge WebView2 runtime. Windows 10 may require the WebView2 runtime as an installer prerequisite.


## Packaged desktop runtime

SupraChat packages the open-source Codex runtime with the desktop application instead of requiring a separate global install.

Current qualification pin:

- Codex `0.159.3`
- upstream release tag `rust-v0.159.3`
- source repository `openai/codex`
- Apache-2.0
- per-platform release assets are SHA-256 verified before they enter the application artifact.

Runtime lookup order is:

1. `runtime/codex/codex[.exe]` beside the packaged application;
2. legacy packaged fallback locations;
3. `codex` from PATH for development only.

Public CI now produces self-contained artifacts for:

- Windows x64 — primary MVP and GUI launch-smoke target;
- Linux x64;
- macOS Apple Silicon.

This mirrors a key property observed in OpenAI's current unified macOS/Linux desktop clients: the local Codex/runtime capability is part of the desktop application rather than an unrelated prerequisite.

The ChatGPT product WebView, SIWC/Responses binding, and bundled Codex runtime remain separate capability planes. The application does not substitute recovered first-party private endpoints for supported integration surfaces.


## Core API and portable SIWC credentials

SupraChat is converging on one semantic Core API shared by the desktop UI, automation CLI, and agent JSON-RPC surfaces. The current tranche keeps the desktop implementation intact while moving authorization status, token refresh, model discovery, and portable credential operations behind the common core.

Portable SIWC credential bundles are encrypted and versioned. Secret-bearing bundle contents are written only to the requested file; command receipts and JSON-RPC results remain redacted.

Automation examples:

```powershell
$env:SUPRACHAT_BUNDLE_PASSPHRASE = "<strong secret>"

SupraChat.Automation.exe auth-status

SupraChat.Automation.exe auth-export --confirm `
  --output .\suprachat-siwc.json `
  --passphrase-env SUPRACHAT_BUNDLE_PASSPHRASE

SupraChat.Automation.exe auth-bundle-inspect `
  --input .\suprachat-siwc.json

SupraChat.Automation.exe auth-import --confirm `
  --input .\suprachat-siwc.json `
  --passphrase-env SUPRACHAT_BUNDLE_PASSPHRASE
```

Equivalent agent methods are:

- `auth/status`
- `auth/bundle/inspect`
- `auth/export`
- `auth/import`

Export/import are consequential operations and require explicit confirmation. Passphrases are supplied from environment variables for automation/agent sessions rather than command-line values.

The first qualified bundle mode is an explicit encrypted **copy**. Multiple copies hold renewable authority and can race the same rotating refresh lineage if independently refreshed. Safe simultaneous ephemeral consumption through a persistent credential broker is intentionally deferred to a later qualification tranche.
