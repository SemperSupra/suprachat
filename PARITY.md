# SupraChat capability/parity ledger

Evidence date: 2026-10-01.

## Scope rule

SupraChat does **not** define scope by the smallest common denominator across clients.

The campaign tracks every consequential capability exposed by any authoritative plane:

1. recovered ChatGPT Android;
2. official ChatGPT Windows desktop;
3. official ChatGPT web/product;
4. documented Sign in with ChatGPT (SIWC) / ChatGPT-plan Responses;
5. pinned open-source Codex CLI/app-server.

A feature missing from one plane remains in the ledger as `SUPPORTED`, `PARTIAL`, `GAP`, `BLOCKED`, or `UNKNOWN`; it is not deleted to make the surfaces look equivalent.

Broad inventory is separate from runtime authority. Destructive, privileged, credential-bearing, or externally consequential capabilities remain explicit-consent/authority operations even when the implementation knows how to invoke them.

## Evidence planes

### Android first-party oracle

- Authority: `SemperSupra/android-artifact-recovery-private#79`
- Public-safe recovery: `SemperSupra/android-artifact-recovery#37`
- Sample: `com.openai.chatgpt` 1.2026.265 / versionCode 2626541
- 20 APK splits; signer-verified.
- Derived markers include WebRTC/realtime voice, media projection, screen share, camera, sharing, push messaging, temporary chat, file library, connectors, conversation bubbles, Codex handoff, PKCE and OAuth device code.

### Windows first-party oracle

- Authority: `SemperSupra/connected-device-recovery-private#59`
- Official Windows help: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9982051
- Windows release notes: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10003026
- Work/Codex desktop behavior: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001275-chatgpt-work-and-codex
- Built-in browser: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001277-using-the-built-in-browser-in-the-chatgpt-desktop-app

Current official documentation establishes Windows-specific surfaces including companion window, desktop Voice, Work/Codex, computer/local-file/app context where available, and a built-in browser with its own state/tabs/download/sign-in behavior. Those are independent parity targets, not assumed to be properties of the web surface.

### SIWC / ChatGPT-plan contract

- Authority: `SemperSupra/agent-dispatch-private#424`
- Current docs: https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source
- Current plan-sharing calls require `store:false` and `stream:true`.
- Model availability is account/plan/workspace dependent and discovered at runtime.
- Text, image and file input are supported where the selected model accepts them.
- Web search and supported function/custom tools are available subject to the current contract/model/policy.
- Unsupported request fields/tools remain in the qualification matrix as typed constraints; the raw Responses surface deliberately lets upstream validation provide the authoritative result rather than silently removing probe fields.

### Codex source/runtime oracle

- Revision: `openai/codex@57ac6f51639f7cad705a48ac4bd8073034a2f150`
- Inventory: `oracles/codex-app-server-surface-20261001.json`
- At this revision: 172 client→server RPC methods, 9 server→client requests and 85 notifications = 266 protocol surfaces.
- Codex is a source-level/runtime oracle and actor candidate. It does not prove implementation details of the proprietary Android or Windows applications.

## Direct SIWC surface policy

SupraChat has two direct Responses paths:

1. typed interview UI for normal text/image/file/web-search qualification;
2. raw Responses console for the complete request surface.

The raw surface:
- preserves arbitrary request fields and tool definitions;
- injects the selected account model when `model` is omitted;
- forces only the current ChatGPT-plan invariants `store:false` and `stream:true`;
- surfaces upstream success/error behavior and request IDs;
- does not reinterpret an upstream rejection as proof that the underlying model can never support the feature through another OpenAI surface.

This is intentionally broader than a hand-authored allowlist.

## Codex full-surface policy

SupraChat uses a generic app-server JSON-RPC transport rather than wrapping only a few methods.

The current client can:
- send arbitrary client RPC methods/params;
- monitor every notification;
- surface every server-initiated request;
- explicitly return a result or rejection to a pending server request;
- run typed Codex interviews using the same refreshed ChatGPT-plan entitlement;
- keep typed convenience flows separate from the generic protocol substrate.

The typed qualification interview currently uses an ephemeral empty workspace, read-only sandbox, no approvals and instructions not to call tools. **That is a qualification fixture, not a global capability restriction.** The generic app-server console retains the complete protocol surface.

## Architecture invariants

1. Do not treat decompiled proprietary implementation as reusable source.
2. Do not scrape browser cookies or depend on undocumented private ChatGPT endpoints.
3. Preserve Android, Windows, web/product, SIWC and Codex as distinct evidence planes.
4. Prefer official first-party product surfaces for first-party product semantics.
5. Use documented SIWC for third-party ChatGPT-plan authorization/inference.
6. Use Codex source/app-server for open-source agent/runtime capabilities.
7. Keep authority and capability distinct: knowing a method exists does not automatically authorize invoking it.
8. Negative results and unsupported surfaces are durable evidence, not reasons to delete a capability from the ledger.

## Windows MVP exit rule

The Windows artifact is a working MVP when it:
- builds and launches self-contained on a clean Windows runner;
- loads the official ChatGPT product surface in a persistent app-owned browser profile;
- can complete normal product sign-in at the user boundary;
- can complete SIWC registration/consent and a real streamed ChatGPT-plan request;
- exposes typed and raw direct Responses surfaces;
- initializes Codex app-server with the same refreshed entitlement;
- can perform a real Codex thread/turn interview;
- exposes the full pinned Codex RPC/notification/server-request substrate;
- stores secrets only in the local credential boundary;
- produces redacted qualification receipts;
- has every discovered Android/Windows/product capability represented in this ledger with an explicit state.

Full Android parity is a later qualification claim and must not be asserted while platform-specific mobile capabilities remain blocked or behaviorally nonequivalent.
